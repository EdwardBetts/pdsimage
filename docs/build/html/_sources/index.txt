====================================

This library has been designed to facilitate the extraction of subpart
of a PDS IMAGES from the LOLA/LROC_WAC experiment.

**Highlighted features**

Unlike  previous python  PDS  library, this  module  allows to  easily
extract  part of  a PDS  image without  loading the  whole thing  into
memory  (Sizes  can  be  up  to  Gigabytes).   Great  for  looking  at
geological unit  on the Moon.  Include some extension to  study impact
crater and lunar domes specifically.
